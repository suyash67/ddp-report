\chapter{Introduction}

The rise of cryptocurrencies have openend up unending possibilities of how minimal or no trust based systems could be established owing to decentralization.
The concept of blockchain was introduced with the founding of Bitcoin by Satoshi Nakamoto \cite{Nakamoto2009}.
Satoshi Nakamoto proposed and implemented idea of a consensus based, trustless, truly peer-to-peer system for financial transactions.  
Notwithstanding an intrumental step towards establishing a decentralized and a trustless system, Bitcoin has several practical limitations with regards to privacy, security and scalability \cite{Conti2018}.   
This led to the development of more privacy and anonymity focussed cryptocurrencies like Monero \cite{Saberhagen2013} and Zcash \cite{Sasson2014}.
Grin \cite{GrinWebsite} and Beam \cite{BeamWebsite} are two relatively new projects which are backed by the MimbleWimble protocol \cite{Poelstra2016} and claim to promise scalability, anonymity and fungibility all at once.
The rise in privacy-centric cryptocurrencies further led to growth in popularity of cryptocurrencies not only among investors but also common people.
