\label{chap:lit}

In this chapter, we briefly discuss the MimbleWimble protocol and Grin, technical details of recently proposed protocols like Improved Inner Product argument, Bulletproofs \cite{Bunz2018} and Omniring \cite{Lai2019} which inspire the design of \RB protocol.
We also describe \R protocol which is the current state-of-the-art proof of reserves protocol for MimbleWimble based cryptocurrencies.
Finally, we will discuss a few limitations of \R which motivated us to design a better proof of reserves protocol.
