\chapter{\textnormal{{\fontfamily{qag}\selectfont RevelioBP}} - Shorter MimbleWimble Proof of Reserves Protocol}
\label{chap:revBP}

\section{Introduction}

MimbleWimble is a design for a scalable cryptocurrency which was proposed in 2016 \cite{Jedusor2016}. Beam and Grin are two implementations of the MimbleWimble protocol which are available on several exchanges \cite{Coinmarketcap}. \R \cite{Dutta2019b} was the first proof of reserves protocol for MimbleWimble coins which provided some privacy to exchanges by hiding the exchange-owned outputs inside an anonymity set of outputs. As the anonymity set is revealed as part of the proof of reserves, a larger anonymity set results in better privacy for the exchange. Since the \R proof size scales linearly with the anonymity set, it becomes an impediment in scaling the anonymity set to the set of all unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs).
To solve the scalability issue of \Rw, we designed \RB leveraging the Bulletproofs \cite{Bunz2018} framework, resulting in the proof size being logarithmic in the anonymity set size.\\[-6pt]   

% \noindent \textbf{Our Contribution.}
\section{Our Contribution}
In this chapter, we present \Rplus, a proof of reserves protocol for MimbleWimble with proof sizes scaling \textit{logarithmcally} in the size of the anonymity set and \textit{linearly} in the size of the exchange-owned output set.
This makes it feasible to choose the anonymity set to be the set of all UTXOs on the blockchain.  
To make quantitative comparisons, we have implemented \RB  in Rust.
At the time of writing this paper, the number of UTXOs on the Grin blockchain is approximately 161,000 \cite{GrinScanWebsite}.
A \R proof of reserves for this anonymity set will have size 42 MB as against 0.27 MB using \RPlus instead.\footnote{Under the assumption that the exchange owns 5\% of all UTXOs.}
This reduction in proof size, however, comes at the cost of larger proof generation and verification times. If an exchange is willing to compromise on the size of the proof and is required to give frequent proofs of reserves,
\R serves as a better choice. If proof sizes are critical for an exchange and it is willing to spend more time generating the proof, \RB clearly outperforms \Rw.   
In conclusion, we quantitatively highlight the trade-off between proof size and performance in using \R and \RBw, both of which are based on the discrete log assumption.
% The design of \RPlus is heavily inspired by the recent Omniring proposal for Monero ring confidential transactions by Lai \textit{et al} \cite{Lai2019}, which itself is based on Bulletproofs \cite{Bunz2018}.

% \section{Overview of Grin}
% \vspace{-4pt}
%Before delving into the details of our protocol, we include a necessary primer in this section to help understand the protocol better.
% \subsection{Notation}
% Let $\mathcal{G} = \{ \G, q, g \}$ be the description of a cyclic group $\G$ of prime order $q$ with generator $g$ of $\G$. Let $h\in \G$ be another random generator of $\G$ such that the discrete logarithm relation between $g$ and $h$ is not known. Let
% $\G^n$ and $\Z^n_q$ be the $n$-ary Cartesian products of sets $\G$ and $\Z_q$ respectively.

% Group elements which are Pedersen commitments are denoted by uppercase letters and randomly chosen group elements are denoted by lowercase letters.

% Bold font denotes vectors.
% Inner product of two vectors $\textbf{a}, \textbf{b} \in \Z_q^n$ is defined as $\langle \textbf{a},\textbf{b} \rangle \coloneqq \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i \cdot b_i$ where $\textbf{a}=(a_1,\dots, a_n), \textbf{b}=(b_1,\dots,b_n)$. Further, Hadamard and Kronecker products are defined respectively as, $\textbf{a} \circ \textbf{b} \coloneqq (a_1 \cdot b_1, \dots, a_n \cdot b_n) \in \mathbb{Z}_q^n$, $\textbf{a} \otimes \textbf{c} \coloneqq (a_1 \textbf{c}, \dots, a_n \textbf{c}) \in \mathbb{Z}_q^{nm}$ where $\textbf{c} \in \mathbb{Z}_q^m$. For a base vector $\textbf{g} = (g_1, \dots, g_n) \in \G^n$, vector exponentiation is defined as $\textbf{g}^{\textbf{a}} = \prod_{i=1}^{n}g_i^{a_i} \in \G$. For a scalar $u \in \Z_q^{\ast}$, we denote its consecutive powers in the form of a vector $\vecnb{u}^{n} \coloneqq (1, u, u^2, \dots, u^{n-1})$.
% To represent the exponentiation of all components of a vector $\textbf{a}$ by the same scalar $k \in \Z_q$, we use $\textbf{a}^{\circ k}$ to mean $(a_1^k, a_2^k, \ldots,a_n^{k})$.
% If an element $a$ is chosen uniformly from a set $A$, such a choice is denoted by $a \rgen A$.
% For a positive integer n, let $[n]$ denote the set $\{1,2,\dots,n\}$.

\section{Outputs in MimbleWimble}

In MimbleWimble, coins are stored in outputs which consist of Pedersen commitments of the form $C = g^rh^a\in \G$ where $g , h \in \G$ and $r,a \in \Z_q$. Here $a$ represents the amount of coins stored in the output and $r$ is a blinding factor. Each commitment is accompanied by a range proof which proves that the amount $a$ lies in the range $\{0,1,2,\ldots,2^{64}-1\}$.

The group elements $g$ and $h$ are assumed to have an unknown discrete logarithm relationship. For example, in Grin $\G$ is the secp256k1 elliptic curve group, $g$ is the base point of the secp256k1 curve, and $h$ is obtained by hashing $g$ with the SHA256 hash function \cite{RustSecp256k1Constants}. The unknown discrete logarithm relationship makes the commitment computationally binding, i.e.~a polynomial-time adversary cannot find $r' \neq r$ and $a' \neq a$ such that $C = g^rh^a = g^{r'}h^{a'}$.

To spend an output having the commitment $C = g^r h^a$, knowledge of the blinding factor $r$ is required \cite{GrinDocOnGithub}. As spending ability is equivalent to ownership, a proof of reserves protocol for MimbleWimble involves a proof of knowledge of blinding factors of several outputs.

\section{From Omniring to \textnormal{{\fontfamily{qag}\selectfont RevelioBP}}}
In Monero, source addresses in a transaction are obfuscated using ring signatures and the amounts are hidden in Pedersen commitments \cite{Noether2016}. 
%The transaction structure, called \textit{ring confidential transaction (RingCT)}, proves that (a) the transaction creator knows one of the private keys corresponding to the public keys in the ring, (b) the sum of the amounts in the input Pedersen commitments is equal to the sum of the amounts in the output Pedersen commitments plus transaction fees, and (c) the output Pedersen commitments contain amounts in a valid range.
The current transaction structure in Monero, called \textit{ring confidential transaction (RingCT)}, has proof sizes which scale linearly in the ring size. Omniring \cite{Lai2019} is a recent proposal for RingCTs with proof sizes which scale logarithmically in the ring size. It relies on Bulletproofs \cite{Bunz2018} to achieve this size reduction. Given a ring $\mathcal{R} = (R_1, R_2,\ldots,R_n)$ of public keys where $R_i = h^{x_i}$ for $h \in \G, x_i \in \Z_q$, the Omniring construction enables a prover to prove knowledge of the private keys $x_{i_1}, x_{i_2},\ldots,x_{i_m}$ corresponding to a subset $\mathcal{R}_{\mathcal{S}}$ of $\mathcal{R}$ without revealing $\mathcal{R}_{\mathcal{S}}$. For each public key $R_j$ in this subset $\mathcal{R}_{\mathcal{S}}$, the prover also outputs a \textit{tag} given by $\textsl{tag}_j = g^{x_j^{-1}}$ for $g \in \G$. This tag is used to detect double spending from a source address.

The design of \RB is inspired by the Omniring construction. Given the set of UTXOs $\C_{\text{utxo}}=(C_1,C_2,\ldots,C_n)$ on the blockchain where $C_i = g^{r_i}h^{a_i}$ for some $r_i, a_i \in \Z_q$, the prover in \RPlus proves knowledge of blinding factors $r_i$ and amounts $a_i$ for all $C_i$ in a subset $\C_{\text{own}}$ of $\C_{\text{utxo}}$ without revealing $\C_{\text{own}}$. For each output $C_j \in \C_{\text{own}}$, the prover outputs a tag $\textsl{tag}_j = g_t^{r_j}h^{a_j}$ where $g_t \in \G$ is a randomly chosen group element. In \Rplus, the tag has a dual role. Firstly, it is used to detect output sharing between exchanges. Secondly, the product of the tags is a Pedersen commitment to the total reserves of the exchange.

\section{\textnormal{{\fontfamily{qag}\selectfont RevelioBP}} Proof of Reserves Protocol}
\label{scnSecurityPropertiesDefiniton}
%In MimbleWimble, coins are stored in outputs which consist of Pedersen commitments of the form $C = g^rh^a\in \G$ where $g , h \in \G$ and $r,a \in \Z_q$.
%Here $a$ represents the amount of coins stored in the output and $r$ is a blinding factor.
%The group elements $g$ and $h$ are assumed to have an unknown discrete logarithm relationship.
%Each commitment is accompanied by a range proof which proves that the amount $a$ lies in a range like $\{0,1,\ldots,2^{64}-1\}$.

To spend a MimbleWimble output having the commitment $C = g^r h^a$, knowledge of the blinding factor $r$ is required \cite{GrinDocOnGithub}.
%As spending ability is equivalent to ownership, a proof of reserves protocol for MimbleWimble involves a proof of knowledge of blinding factors of several outputs.
Technically, the ability to spend an output also requires knowledge of the amount $a$. But the amount can be at most $2^{64}-1$, and hence can be found by brute force search given $C$ and $r$.

Let $\C_{\text{utxo}}^t$ be the set of UTXOs on a MimbleWimble blockchain after the block with height $t$ has been mined. An exchange will own a subset $\C_{\text{own}}^t \subset \C_{\text{utxo}}^t$, where ownership implies knowledge of the blinding factor for each output $C \in \C_{\text{own}}^t$.  Using the \RB protocol, the exchange can construct a Pedersen commitment $C_{\text{res}}$ to an amount which is equal to the sum of the amounts commited to by each of the outputs in $\C_{\text{own}}^t$.  Given a Pedersen commitment $C_{\text{liab}}$ to the total liabilities of the exchange, it can give a proof of solvency via a range proof which shows that the amount committed to in $C_{\text{res}}C_{\text{liab}}^{-1}$ is non-negative. If there is no suitable method to construct $\C_{\text{liab}}$, then the exchange can reveal a base amount $a_{\text{base}}$ and prove that $\C_{\text{res}}h^{-a_{\text{base}}}$ is a commitment to a non-negative amount.

While \RPlus does not reveal $\C_{\text{own}}^t$, it does reveal its cardinality $s_t = \left| \C_{\text{own}}^t \right|$.
% While this may seem like a privacy concern, an exchange can create some outputs which have zero amount in them for the purpose of \textit{padding} the cardinality.
We give a reasonable workaround for this issue in Section \ref{scnProofGeneration}.



%% Briefly state the properties of Revelio+
If the Decisional Diffie-Hellman (DDH) assumption holds in the group $\G$, the \RPlus proof of reserves protocol satisfies the following properties:
\pointsStart
\item \textit{Inflation resistance}: Using \RBw, a probabilistic polynomial time (\textsf{PPT}) exchange will not be able to generate a commitment to an amount which exceeds the reserves it actually owns.% Moreover, the exchange also cannot generate a commitment to an amount lesser than what it owns prohibiting under-reporting of reserves.
\item \textit{Collusion detection}: Situations where two exchanges share an output while generating their respective \RPlus proofs will be detected.
\item \textit{Output privacy}: A \textsf{PPT} adversary who observes \RPlus proofs from an exchange cannot do any better than random guessing while identifying members of $C_{\text{own}}^t$.
\pointsEnd

The security proofs are given in Section \ref{scnSecurityProperties}.

\subsection{Proof Generation}
\label{scnProofGeneration}
The \RPlus protocol requires one randomly chosen group element $g_t \in \G$ per block such that the discrete log relation between $g_t$ and $g,h$ is unknown.
All the exchanges need to agree upon the procedure used to generate the sequence of $g_t$s.
For example, $g_t$ could be generated by hashing the contents of the block at height $t$. An exchange giving a \RPlus proof of its reserves at the block with height $t$ performs the following procedure:
\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=3pt]
  \item From the UTXO set $\C_{\text{utxo}}^t$ at block $t$, the exchange constructs the vector $\textbf{C} = (C_1,C_2,\dots, C_n)$ where the $C_i$s are all the UTXOs arranged in the order of their appearance on the blockchain. So $n = \left| \C_{\text{utxo}}^t \right|$.
  To keep the notation simple, we do not make the dependence of $\textbf{C}$ and $n$ on $t$ explicit.
  \item The exchange owns a subset $\C_{\text{own}}^t = \{C_{i_1}, C_{i_2},\ldots,C_{i_s}\}$ of $\C_{\text{utxo}}^t$ where $1 \le i_1 < \cdots < i_s \le n$.
  % Once again, we suppress the dependence of $s$ on $t$ for notational simplicity.
  For each $C_{i_j} \in \C_{\text{own}}^t$, the exchange knows $r_{j}$ and $a_{j}$ such that $C_{i_j} = g^{r_j}h^{a_j}$.
  Using this information, the exchange constructs the \textit{tag vector} $\textbf{I} = (I_1, I_2, \ldots, I_s)$ where $I_j = g_t^{r_j}h^{a_j}$.
  Note that $I_j$ is a Pedersen commitment to the amount $a_{j}$ with blinding factor $r_{j}$ using bases $g_t$, $h$.
  So the only difference between $C_{i_j}$ and $I_j$ is that the base $g$ in the former is replaced with $g_t$ in the latter.

  \item Let $\textbf{a} = (a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_s)$ and $\textbf{r} = (r_1, r_2, \ldots,r_s)$ be the amount and blinding factor vectors corresponding to the exchange-owned outputs. Let $\textbf{e}_{i_j} \in \{0,1\}^n$ be the unit vector with a $1$ in position $i_j$ and $0$s everywhere else. Let $\Emat \in \{0,1\}^{s \times n}$ be the matrix with $\textbf{e}_{i_1},\textbf{e}_{i_2},\ldots,\textbf{e}_{i_s}$ as rows.

  The exchange publishes $(t, \textbf{I})$ and generates a zero-knowledge argument of knowledge \proto of quantities $(\Emat, \textbf{a}, \textbf{r})$ such that for all $j=1,2,\ldots,s$
  \begin{equation}
    \textbf{C}^{\textbf{e}_{i_j}} = g^{r_j}h^{a_j}, \ I_j = g_t^{r_j}h^{a_j}.
    \label{eqnTagConstruction}
  \end{equation}
 

  \item The exchange publishes its \RPlus proof as $\left(  t, \textbf{I}, \Uppi_{\RBmath} \right)$ and claims that $C_{\text{res}} = \prod_{j=1}^s I_j$ is a Pedersen commitment to its reserves $\sum_{j=1}^{s}a_j$.
\end{enumerate}
Note that the tag $I_j$ is a deterministic function of the output $C_{i_j}$ at a given block height $t$. So if two exchanges try to use the same output in their respective \RPlus proofs, the same tag $I_j$ will appear in both their proofs, revealing the collusion.

The reason for changing the base $g_t$ with the block height is to change the tag of the same output across \RPlus proofs at different block heights. If $g_t$ were unchanged (as in \R \cite{Dutta2019b}), then the appearance of the same tag in two \RPlus proofs at different block heights will reveal that some exchange-owned output has remained unspent between these two block heights.

As $C_\text{res}$ is a Pedersen commitment with respect to bases $g_t$ and $h$, the Pedersen commitment $C_{\text{liab}}$ to the exchange's liabilities should also be generated using these bases. Otherwise, it will be not be possible to generate a range proof on $C_{\text{res}}C_{\text{liab}}^{-1}$.

The proof reveals the cardinality $s$ of $\C_{\text{own}}^t$. 
An exchange which wants to hide the number of outputs it owns can create some outputs which commit to the zero amount and use these to pad the outputs with non-zero amounts.
For example, suppose that the number of outputs owned by the exchange is expected to be in the range 600 to 1000. It can create 400 outputs which commit to the zero amount and use these to always pad the number $s$ revealed in the proof to be always 1000.
Of course, the exchange would need to spend a nominal amount as transaction fees in creation of such outputs.

Finally, note that an exchange can under-report its reserves by excluding an output it owns from the subset $\C_{\text{own}}^t$ used to generate the \RPlus proof. An exchange may choose to do this if its liabilities are much lower than its reserves.

\subsection{Proof Verification}
Given a \RPlus proof of reserves $(t, \textbf{I}, \Uppi_{\RBmath})$ from an exchange referring to the block height $t$, the verifier performs the following procedure:
\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=3pt]
\item First, it reads the set of all UTXOs at block height $t$ and forms the vector $\textbf{C} = (C_1, \dots, C_n)$ such that $C_i$s are listed in the order of their appearance on the blockchain.

\item It verifies the argument of knowledge $\Uppi_{\RBmath}$ by checking that the verification equations described in Figure \ref{fig:protocol_revBP} hold.

\item Finally, the verifier checks if any of the tags in the $\textbf{I}$ vector appear in another exchange's \RPlus proof for the same block height $t$. If the same tag $I_j$ appears in the \RPlus proofs of two different exchanges, then collusion is declared and the proofs is considered invalid.
\end{enumerate}



\section{ZK Argument of Knowledge \proto}
\label{scnArgumentOfKnowledge}
Let $\textbf{C} = (C_1,\ldots,C_n)$ be the vector representation of the UTXO set $\C_{\text{utxo}}^t$ at block height $t$.
Let $\textbf{I} = (I_1, \ldots, I_s)$ be the tag vector published by the exchange as part of the \RPlus proof.
The exchange constructs an argument of knowledge \proto to convince a verifier of the following:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item[(i)] It knows $r_j$ and $a_j$ such that $I_j = g_t^{r_j}h^{a_j}$ $\forall j \in [s]$.\\[-8pt]
  \item[(ii)] $\exists i_j \in [n]$ (index) such that $C_{i_j} = g^{r_j}h^{a_j}$ $\forall j \in [s]$.
\end{enumerate}
\vspace{1mm}
Note that while the existence of the indices $i_j$ will be proved by \protow, the indices themselves are not revealed. 
Since the term $h^{a_j}$ is common in both equations in the above statements, combining the two equations, 
we can equivalently state that the exchange knows $r_j$ and $i_j$ such the following holds for all $j \in [s]$
\begin{equation}
  I_j g_t^{-r_j} = C_{i_j} g^{-r_j}.
\end{equation}
%
%This is possible because an honest exchange could construct a valid $I_j$ even if it does not know the amount $a_j$.
In other words, knowledge of $r_j$ and $i_j$ for all $j \in [s]$ suffices for an honest exchange to construct \protow.


Consider the language \lang given in (\ref{eqnRevelioPlusLanguage}) where 
$\textbf{r} = (r_1,r_2,\ldots,r_s) \in \Z_q^s$
and $\textbf{e}_{i_j} \in \{0,1\}^n$ is a unit vector with a 1 at index $i_j$ and zeros everywhere else.
The language depends on the common reference string $\textsl{crs}=\{\G, q, g, h, g_t\}$.
\begin{align}
\L_{\RBmath} = \hspace{-1mm}
\left\{ ( \textbf{C}, \textbf{I}) \Bigg| 
\text{
\begin{tabular}{c} 
$\exists (\textbf{r}, \textbf{e}_{i_1},\ldots,\textbf{e}_{i_s}) \text{ such that }$
\\ 
$I_j g_t^{-r_j} = \textbf{C}^{\textbf{e}_{i_j}} g^{-r_j} \ \forall j \in [s]$
\end{tabular}
}
\hspace{-1mm}
\right\}
\label{eqnRevelioPlusLanguage}
\end{align}

To leverage the Bulletproofs framework for the construction of a \textit{log}-sized argument of knowledge for the language
\langw, we need to do the following:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item[(i)] Embed the secrets $(\textbf{r}, \textbf{e}_{i_1},\ldots,\textbf{e}_{i_s})$ as the exponents in a Pedersen vector commitment satisfying some inner product relation.
  \item[(ii)] Using the public information $(\textbf{C}, \textbf{I})$, construct the base vectors of the Pedersen vector commitment in such a way that the prover would not know the discrete logarithm relation between elements of the base vectors.  
\end{enumerate}

The first requirement seems natural since the Bulletproofs technique helps us prove the knowledge of exponents in a Pedersen vector commitment satisfying some inner product relations.
The second one is a more technical requirement. In Bulletproofs, the elements in the base vectors $\textbf{g}, \textbf{h} \in \G^n$ are uniformly chosen from the group $\G$ to ensure 
that a discrete logarithm relation between them is not known to a \textsf{PPT} prover. The soundness of the Bulletproofs protocol relies on this assumption.
Lai \textit{et al} \cite{Lai2019} noted that if base vector components are chosen from a blockchain a prover might know the discrete logarithm relation between them.
To solve this problem, they proposed using a base vector which is the Hadamard product of the vectors taken from the blockchain (with a random exponent) and a randomly chosen base vector.

To construct a base vector satisfying the above requirements, we write the statement of $\mathcal{L}_{\textsf{RevBP}}$ from (\ref{eqnRevelioPlusLanguage}) as 
\begin{gather}
  g^{-r_j} g_t^{r_j} \textbf{C}^{\textbf{e}_{i_j}} I_j^{-1} = 1 \ \forall j \in [s]. \label{eqnCombinedStatement}
  \intertext{For $u \rgen \Z_q$, combining the above constraints, we have}
  \prod_{j \in [s]} \left(g^{-r_j} g_t^{r_j} \textbf{C}^{\textbf{e}_{i_j}} I_j^{-1}\right)^{u^{j-1}} = 1, \nonumber \\
  \hspace{-1.5cm} \implies \hspace{0.8cm} g^{- \langle \vecnb{u}^s, \vecnb{r} \rangle} g_t^{\langle \vecnb{u}^s, \vecnb{r} \rangle} \textbf{C}^{ \vecnb{u}^s \Emat} \textbf{I}^{- \vecnb{u}^s} = 1,
  \label{eqnMainEqualityCompressed}
\end{gather}
where $\Emat$ is a $s \times n$ matrix having the $\textbf{e}_{i_j}$ vectors as rows.
We write the exponents in (\ref{eqnMainEqualityCompressed}) as \textit{compressed secrets},
namely $\xi = -\langle \vecnb{u}^s, \vecnb{r} \rangle, \ \xi^{\prime} = \langle \vecnb{u}^s, \vecnb{r} \rangle, \ \hat{\textbf{e}} = \vecnb{u}^s \Emat$ and let $\hat{I} = \textbf{I}^{-\vecnb{u}^s}$.  
Given a vector $\textbf{p} \in \G^{n+3}$ and a scalar $w \in \Z_q$, we construct the base and exponent vectors as follows
\begin{align}
    \textbf{g}_w^{\prime} & \coloneqq \big( (g\|g_t\|\textbf{C}\| \hat{I})^{\circ w} \circ \textbf{p} \big),
    \label{eqnBaseCompressed} \\
    \textbf{a}^{\prime} & \coloneqq (\xi \| \xi^{\prime} \| \hat{\textbf{e}} \| 1).
    \label{eqnExpCompressed}
\end{align}
Note that the compressed secrets are a linear combination of the actual secrets.
We need to append the actual secrets $(\textbf{r}, \textbf{e}_{i_1}, \dots, \textbf{e}_{i_s})$ for completeness to (\ref{eqnExpCompressed}). Thus, we have
\begin{align}
  \textbf{g}_w & \coloneqq \big[ \big( (g\|g_t\|\textbf{C}\| \hat{I})^{\circ w} \circ \textbf{p} \big) \| \textbf{g}^{\prime} \big],
  \label{eqnBase}\\
  \textbf{a} & \coloneqq \big[ (\xi \| \xi^{\prime} \| \hat{\textbf{e}} \| 1) \| (\textbf{e}_{i_1} \| \dots \| \textbf{e}_{i_s} \| \textbf{r}) \big].
  \label{eqnExp}
\end{align} 
where $\textbf{g}^{\prime} \rgen \G^{sn+s}$.
We now state a lemma in regards to the non-trivial discrete-log relation between the components of the base vector $\textbf{g}_w$.% and prove it in Appendix \ref{proofThmNoDLBase}.
\begin{lemma}\label{thmNoDLBase}
  If the components of $\textbf{p}$ are chosen uniformly from $\G$ and independent of $(\textbf{C}, \textbf{I})$, 
  then a \textsf{PPT} adversary cannot find a non-trival discrete logarithm relation between components of $\textbf{g}_w$.
\end{lemma}
\textit{Proof}: 
As the components of $\textbf{p}$ and $\textbf{g}^{\prime}$ are uniformly chosen from $\G$, the components of $\textbf{g}_w$ are iid with a uniform distribution in $\G$.  
Hence a PPT adversary cannot find a non-trivial discrete logarithm relation between these components.
\hfill {\small \qed}




% Concretely, let us concentrate on proving knowledge of only one unit vector $\textbf{e}_{i_j}$ for some $j \in [s]$ and the corresponding scalar $r_j$. 
% From (\ref{eqnRevelioPlusLanguage}), we can write
% \begin{gather}
%     g^{-r_j} g_t^{r_j} \textbf{C}^{\textbf{e}_{i_j}} I_j^{-1} = 1. \label{eqnCombinedStatement}
%     % \intertext{For $u \rgen \Z_q$, we have}
%     % \left(g^{-r_j} g_t^{r_j} \textbf{C}^{\textbf{e}_{i_j}} I_j^{-1}\right)^u =  g^{-u r_j} g_t^{u r_j} \textbf{C}^{u\textbf{e}_{i_j}} I_j^{-u} = 1.
%     % \label{eqnMainEqualityCompressed}
% \end{gather}
% Given a vector $\textbf{p} \in \G^{n+3}$ and a scalar $w \in \Z_q$, we construct the base and exponent vectors as follows
% \begin{align}
%     \textbf{g}_w^{\prime} & \coloneqq \left((g\|g_t\|\textbf{C}\|I_j^{-u})^{\circ w} \circ \textbf{p} \right),
%     \label{eqnBaseCompressed}\\
%     \textbf{a}^{\prime} & \coloneqq (-r_j \| r_j \| \textbf{e}_{i_j} \| 1).
%     \label{eqnExpCompressed}
% \end{align}

% Note that $(\textbf{g}_w^{\prime})^{\textbf{a}^{\prime}} = (\textbf{g}^{\prime}_{w^{\prime}})^{\textbf{a}^{\prime}}$ for any $w, w^{\prime} \in \Z_q$ owing to the equality in (\ref{eqnCombinedStatement}).
% We now state a lemma in regards to the non-trivial discrete-log relation between the elements of the base vector $\textbf{g}_w^{\prime}$ and prove it in Appendix \ref{proofThmNoDLBase}.

% \begin{lemma}\label{thmNoDLBase}
%   If the components of $\textbf{p}$ are chosen uniformly and independent of $(\textbf{C}, \textbf{I})$, then there is no non-trival discrete logarithm relation between elements in $\textbf{g}_w^{\prime}$.
% \end{lemma}

% \noindent We prove the above lemma in Appendix \ref{proofThmNoDLBase}.
% Further, we can write the exponents in form of a secret vector as 
% % Further, let the \textit{compressed secrets} (exponents) be $\xi_j = -u r_j,\ \xi^{\prime} = u r_j,\ \hat{\textbf{e}}_j = u \textbf{e}_{i_j}$ and let the corresponding vector be
% \begin{equation}\label{eqnExpCompressed}
%   \textbf{a}^{\prime} \coloneqq (-r_j \| r_j \| \textbf{e}_{i_j} \| 1).
% \end{equation}

We can now construct a Pedersen vector commitment as $A = (h^{\prime})^{r}\textbf{g}_w^{\textbf{a}} \textbf{h}^{\textbf{b}}$ for appropriately chosen $\textbf{b} \in \Z_q^{N}, \textbf{h} \rgen \G^{N}$ where $N = |\textbf{a}|$,
satisfying the first requirement in using the Bulletproofs framework.
Owing to (\ref{eqnMainEqualityCompressed}), (\ref{eqnBase}), (\ref{eqnExp}), we have $\textbf{g}_w^{\textbf{a}} = \textbf{g}_{w^{\prime}}^{\textbf{a}}$ for any $w, w^{\prime} \in \Z_q$.
Thus, the above vector commitment to $\textbf{a}$ remains the same for any $w \in \Z_q$. By successfully running the Bulletproofs protocol twice on $A$ with respect to two different bases
$(h^{\prime} \| \textbf{g}_w \| \textbf{h})$ and $(h^{\prime} \| \textbf{g}_{w^{\prime}} \| \textbf{h})$ we can extract the secret vector $\textbf{a}$ such that $A = (h^{\prime})^{r}\textbf{g}_w^{\textbf{a}} \textbf{h}^{\textbf{b}} = (h^{\prime})^{r}\textbf{g}_{w^{\prime}}^{\textbf{a}} \textbf{h}^{\textbf{b}}$.
This solves the problem of extractability (soundness) of the protocol.
In summary, we are now ready to construct a Bulletproofs-based argument of knowledge proving that the exchange owns some outputs from the entire set of UTXOs.
The next step is to develop an inner product relation between the secret vectors $\textbf{a}$ and $\textbf{b}$ to enable us in designing a Bulletproofs-like protocol.

% To prove knowledge of the exact secrets $(r_j, \textbf{e}_{i_j})$, we append the above base and the exponent vectors with $\textbf{g}^{\prime} \rgen \G^{n+1}$ and $(\textbf{e}_{i_j} \| r_j)$ respectively.
% \begin{align}
%     \textbf{g}_w &\coloneqq \left[((g\|g_t\|\textbf{C}\|I_j^{-u})^w \circ \textbf{p}) \| \textbf{g}^{\prime}\right]. \\
%     \textbf{a} &\coloneqq \left[(\xi_j \| \xi_j^{\prime} \| \hat{\textbf{e}}_j \| 1) \ \| \ (\textbf{e}_{i_j} \| r_j) \right].
% \end{align}

% Using the new base vector $\textbf{g}_{w}$ and secret vector $\textbf{a}$, we can prove the knowledge of $(r_j, \textbf{e}_{i_j})$ using Bulletproofs. 
% % Appealing to a slightly modified version of Lemma \ref{thmNoDLBase}, the elements of the base vector $\textbf{g}_w$ have no non-trival discrete logarithm relation between them.
% In summary, we can now construct a Bulletproofs-based argument of knowledge proving that the exchange owns one output from the entire set of UTXOs.
% To prove the knowledge of multiple such exchange-owned outputs, we use the aggregated Bulletproofs technique to give a consolidated Bulletproofs-like protocol.

% More precisely, to prove the knowledge of $(\textbf{r}, \textbf{e}_{i_1}, \dots, \textbf{e}_{i_s})$, we combine the statements in (\ref{eqnCombinedStatement}), for all $j \in [s]$,
% by raising them to powers of $u \in \Z_q$.
% \begin{gather}
%   \prod_{j=1}^{s} \big( g^{-r_j} g_t^{r_j} \textbf{C}^{\textbf{e}_{i_j}} I_j^{-1}\big)^{u^{j-1}} = 1. \nonumber \\
%   g^{- \sum_{1}^{s} r_j u^{j-1} } \cdot g_t^{\sum_{1}^{s} r_j u^{j-1} } \cdot \prod_{1}^{s} \big( \textbf{C}^{u^{j-1} \textbf{e}_{i_j}} \big)\big( I_j^{-u^{j-1}} \big) = 1. \nonumber
% \end{gather}

% \noindent Using the notation defined in Fig. (\ref{label:notation}), we get 
% \begin{equation}
%   g^{\xi}\cdot g_t^{\xi^{\prime}} \cdot \textbf{C}^{\hat{\textbf{e}}} \cdot \hat{I} = 1.
% \end{equation} 
% \noindent We refer to the above equlity as \textit{main equality}. The base and the exponent vectors become 
% \begin{gather}
%   \textbf{g}_w \coloneqq \left[((g\|g_t\|\textbf{C}\|\hat{I})^w \circ \textbf{p}) \| \textbf{g}^{\prime}\right]. \\
%   \cL \coloneqq \left[(\xi \| \xi^{\prime} \| \hat{\textbf{e}} \| 1) \ \| \ (\Emat \| \vecnb{r}) \right].
% \end{gather}
% \noindent where $\textbf{g}^{\prime} \rgen \G^{sn +s}$. The definition of second secret vector $\cR$ is shown in Fig. (\ref{label:witness}).
% Using constraint vectors defined in Fig. (\ref{fig:conVec1}, \ref{fig:conVec2}), we construct inner-product based relations between the secret vectors $(\cL, \cR)$ as 
% shown in Fig. (\ref{fig:syseqn}). Note that the constraint vectors depend only on the public-coin challenges from the verifier.

\subsection{Building Inner Product Relation}

We have computed the secret vector $\textbf{a}$ and the base vector $\textbf{g}_w$ given by equations (\ref{eqnBaseCompressed}), (\ref{eqnExpCompressed}) overcoming the difficulties in using a Bulletproofs-like framework.
We rename secret vectors $\textbf{a}, \textbf{b}$ as $\cL, \cR \in \Z_q^N$ respectively and define them in Figure \ref{fig:witness}.
Note that $\cR$ is defined based on $\cL$. We now wish to construct an inner product relationship between $\cL$ and $\cR$.
We use vector indexing starting from $1$, i.e. $\cL[k_1:k_2] = (\cL[k_1], \cL[k_1+1], \dots, \cL[k_2-1])$ where $k_1, k_2 \in \N, k_1 < k_2$. 
\begin{enumerate}
  \item[(i)] $\textbf{e}_L = \cL[n+4: n+4+sn] = \textsl{vec}(\Emat) \in \{0,1\}^{sn}$ and $\textbf{e}_R = \cR[n+4: n+4+sn] = \textbf{1}^{sn} - \textsl{vec}(\Emat) \in \{0,1\}^{sn}$, i.e. those slices are element-wise binary complements.
  Therefore, for a scalar vector $\vecnb{y}^{sn} \in \Z_q^{sn}$, we should have $ \textbf{e}_L \circ (\textbf{e}_R \circ \vecnb{y}^{sn}) = \textbf{0}^{sn}$, leading to inner-product constraint (\ref{ceq0}).
  \item[(ii)] Next, compressed secrets $\xi, \xi^{\prime}$ are related such that $\xi + \xi^{\prime} = 0$ and $\xi = -\langle \vecnb{u}^s, \textbf{r}\rangle$.
  This means that for a scalar $v \in \Z_q$, we must have 
  \begin{gather*}
    v \xi + \xi^{\prime} = (v-1)\xi = -(v-1) \langle \vecnb{u}^s, \textbf{r}\rangle, \\
    \implies \xi + \xi^{\prime} + \langle (v-1)\vecnb{u}^s, \textbf{r}\rangle = 0.
  \end{gather*}
  This leads us to the constraint (\ref{ceq1}).

  \item[(iii)] We have the compressed secret vector for indices as
  \begin{equation*}
    \hat{\textbf{e}} = \vecnb{u}^s \Emat = (0, 0, \underbrace{1}_{i_1}, \dots, \underbrace{u}_{i_2}, \dots, \underbrace{u^2}_{i_3}, \dots, \underbrace{u^{s-1}}_{i_s}, \dots, 0, 0) \in \Z_q^n.
  \end{equation*} 
  To prove that $\hat{\textbf{e}}$ actually is of this form, we multiply it with a scalar vector $\vecnb{y}^{n}$.
  \begin{equation*}
    \vecnb{y}^n \circ \hat{\textbf{e}} = (0, 0, \underbrace{y^{i_1} \cdot 1}_{i_1}, \dots, \underbrace{y^{i_2} \cdot u}_{i_2}, \dots, \underbrace{y^{i_3} \cdot u^2}_{i_3}, \dots, \underbrace{y^{i_s} \cdot u^{s-1}}_{i_s}, \dots, 0, 0) \in \Z_q^n.
  \end{equation*} 
  Now we get this same structure if we do the following: $\textbf{e}_L \circ (\vecnb{u}^s \otimes \vecnb{y}^n)$ leading us to constraint (\ref{ceq2}).

  \item[(iv)] We know that if we add up all the elements of $\textbf{e}_L \circ (\vecnb{y}^s \otimes \textbf{1}^n)$, we will get the sum as $\sum_{j=1}^s y^{j-1}$.
  To prove that $\cL[n+3] = 1$, if we multiply $\cL[n+3]$ with $y^s$ and add it to the sum computed above, we must get $\langle \textbf{1}^{s+1},\vecnb{y}^{s+1} \rangle$, leading us to constraint (\ref{ceq3}).
  
  \item[(v)] Lastly, to ensure that elements of $\textbf{e}_L$ and $\textbf{e}_R$ are actually $\{0,1\}$, checking if $\langle \textbf{e}_L + \textbf{e}_R - \vecnb{1}^{sn}, \vecnb{y}^{sn} \rangle = 0$ should suffice.
  This forms the last constraint (\ref{ceq4}). 
\end{enumerate}
\noindent
Now, we have all the required relations between the secret vectors in Figure \ref{fig:syseqn} to ensure that an honest prover's witness encoding is correct.
We now combine all these constraints in a single inner product relation by multiplying each and constraint by a power of a scalar and adding them up.
\begin{multline*}
  \langle \cL, \cR  \circ \textbf{v}_0 \rangle + 
  z \cdot \langle \cL , \textbf{v}_{1} \rangle +
  z^2 \cdot \langle \cL, \textbf{v}_2 \rangle + \\
  z^3 \cdot \langle \cL, \textbf{v}_3 \rangle  +
  z^4 \cdot \langle \cL + \cR - \vecnb{1}^{t}, \textbf{v}_{4} \rangle 
  = z^3 \cdot \langle \vecnb{1}^{s+1}, \vecnb{y}^{s+1} \rangle,
\end{multline*}
\begin{gather*}
  \implies
  \langle \cL, \cR  \circ \textbf{v}_0 \rangle + \langle \cL , \sum_{i=1}^{4} z^i \cdot \textbf{v}_{i} \rangle 
  + \langle \cR, z^4 \cdot \textbf{v}_{4} \rangle
  =
  z^3 \cdot \langle \vecnb{1}^{s+1}, \vecnb{y}^{s+1} \rangle
  + \langle \vecnb{1}^{t}, z^4 \cdot \textbf{v}_{4} \rangle
\end{gather*}
Substituting the compressed constraint vectors $\vecnb{\theta}, \vecnb{\mu}, \vecnb{\nu}$ as defined in Figure \ref{fig:conVec2}, 
\begin{gather*}
  \implies
  \langle \cL, \cR  \circ \vecnb{\theta} \rangle + \langle \cL , \vecnb{\mu} \rangle 
  + \langle \cR, \vecnb{\nu} \rangle
  =
  z^3 \cdot \langle \vecnb{1}^{s+1}, \vecnb{y}^{s+1} \rangle
  + \langle \vecnb{1}^{t}, \vecnb{\nu} \rangle,
\end{gather*}
Combining the first and third terms on the lhs using constraint vector $\vecnb{\theta}^{\circ -1}$,
\begin{gather*}
  \implies
  \langle \cL, \cR  \circ \vecnb{\theta} \rangle + \langle \cL , \vecnb{\mu} \rangle 
  + \langle \cR \circ \vecnb{\theta}, \vecnb{\nu} \circ \vecnb{\theta}^{\circ -1} \rangle
  =
  z^3 \cdot \langle \vecnb{1}^{s+1}, \vecnb{y}^{s+1} \rangle
  + \langle \vecnb{1}^{t}, \vecnb{\nu} \rangle,\\
  % %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \implies
  \langle \cL + \vecnb{\nu} \circ \vecnb{\theta}^{\circ -1}, \cR  \circ \vecnb{\theta} \rangle 
  + \langle \cL , \vecnb{\mu} \rangle 
  =
  z^3 \cdot \langle \vecnb{1}^{s+1}, \vecnb{y}^{s+1} \rangle
  + \langle \vecnb{1}^{t}, \vecnb{\nu} \rangle,\\
  % %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \intertext{Substituting compressed constraint vector $\vecnb{\alpha}$ and scalar $\delta$, we get}
  \implies
  \langle \cL + \vecnb{\alpha}, \cR  \circ \vecnb{\theta} \rangle 
  + \langle \cL , \vecnb{\mu} \rangle 
  =
  \delta,\\
  \implies
  \langle \cL + \vecnb{\alpha}, \cR  \circ \vecnb{\theta} \rangle + \vecnb{\mu}
  =
  \delta + \langle \vecnb{\mu}, \vecnb{\alpha} \rangle
\end{gather*}
The final equation is the required single inner product relation.
We can now proceed in constructing a Bulletproofs-like protocol for this inner product relation.  

The interactive protocol $\Uppi_{\RBmath} = (\textsl{Setup}, \langle \P, \V \rangle)$ for the language $\mathcal{L}_{\RBmath}$ is shown in Figure \ref{fig:protocol_revBP}. Note that \textsl{Setup}, prover $\mathcal{P}$ and verifier $\V$ are \textsf{PPT} algorithms.
The notation used in the protocol is given in Fig. \ref{fig:notation}, \ref{fig:witness}, \ref{fig:conVec1}, \ref{fig:conVec2}, \ref{fig:syseqn}.

% % \vspace{2pt}
% \noindent \textit{Note}: The definition of constraint vectors $\vecnb{\alpha}$ and $\vecnb{\beta}$ contain the term $\vecnb{\theta}^{\circ -1}$.
% % In the last verification equation, we use a modified base vector $\textbf{h}^{\prime} = \textbf{h}^{\vecnb{\theta}^{\circ -1}}$.
% For this to be valid, $\vecnb{\theta}^{\circ -1}$ must be well defined, which implies that $\vecnb{\theta}$ must be element-wise non-zero. This is why 
% we use some non-zero $v \in \Z_q \setminus \{0\}$ in the definition of the constraint vector $\textbf{v}_0$. No matter what $v$ is chosen,
% the corresponding inner-product relation given by (\ref{eq1}) remains unaltered.\\[-2pt]


  
  
  
  % In the last step of Protocol (\ref{fig:protocol_revBP}), the first verification equation checks if $\hat{t}$, which was sent by the prover,
  % was computed correctly as the inner-product of vectors $\lvec(x) \text{ and } \rvec(x)$ for challenge $x \in \Z_q$.
  % Since we had defined $\hat{t}(x) = \langle \lvec(x), \rvec(x) \rangle = t_0 + t_1x + t_2x^2$, the second verification equation checks if 
  % $\hat{t}$ satisfies the quantity $(t_0 + t_1x + t_2x^2)$.  
  
  As the prover has to send vectors $\lvec, \rvec \in \Z_q^N$ in the last round, the \proto protocol results in a communication cost of $\mathcal{O}(N)$ for the prover, where $N$ is the length of the secret vectors.
  We reduce this to $\mathcal{O}(\text{log}_2(N))$ using the inner-product argument in \cite{Bunz2018}. Concretely, the language for the inner-product argument is expressed as 
  % \begin{equation}
  %   \L_{\textsf{IP}} = \big\{ (P,c)\in \G \ \big| \ \exists (\textbf{a}, \textbf{b}) \hspace{-1mm}: P = u^{c}\textbf{g}^{\textbf{a}} \textbf{b}^{\textbf{b}} \wedge c = \langle \textbf{a}, \textbf{b} \rangle \big\}
  %   \label{eqnIPALanguage}
  % \end{equation}
  \begin{equation}
    \L_{\textsf{IP}} = \hspace{-1mm}
    \left\{ 
    \hspace{-0.5mm}  
    P \in \G, c \in \Z_q \Bigg| 
    \text{
    \hspace{-3mm}
    \begin{tabular}{c}
    $\exists (\textbf{a}, \textbf{b}) \text{ such that }$
    \\ 
    $P = u^{c}\textbf{g}^{\textbf{a}} \textbf{h}^{\textbf{b}} \wedge c = \langle \textbf{a}, \textbf{b} \rangle$
    \end{tabular}
    \hspace{-3mm}
    }
    \hspace{-1.5mm}
    \right\}
    \label{eqnIPALanguage}
  \end{equation}
  
  % \begin{align*}
  %   \L_{\textsf{IP}} = \hspace{-1mm}
  %   \left\{ (P, c) \in \G \Bigg| 
  %   \text{

  %   \begin{tabular}{c}
  %   $\exists (\textbf{a}, \textbf{b}) \text{ such that }$
  %   \\ 
  %   $P = u^{c}\textbf{g}^{\textbf{a}} \textbf{b}^{\textbf{b}} \wedge c = \langle \textbf{a}, \textbf{b} \rangle$
  %   \end{tabular}
  %   \hspace{-3mm}
  %   }
  %   \hspace{-1mm}
  %   \right\}
  %   \label{eqnIPALanguage}
  % \end{align*}
  
  \noindent where $\textbf{a}, \textbf{b} \in \Z_q^{|\textbf{a}|}$, $\textbf{g}, \textbf{h} \rgen \G^{|\textbf{a}|}, \ u \rgen \G$.
  Thus, in our case, we construct a Pedersen vector commitment to $(\lvec, \rvec)$
  \begin{align*}
    P = u^{\hat{t}} \textbf{g}^{\lvec}_w (\textbf{h}^{\prime})^\rvec = u^{\hat{t}} (h^{\prime})^{-r} AS^{x} \textbf{g}^{\vecnb{\alpha}}_w \textbf{h}^{\vecnb{\beta}},
  \end{align*}
  
  \noindent where $\textbf{h}^{\prime} = \textbf{h}^{\vecnb{\theta}^{\circ -1}}$. 
  Note that $P$, as shown above, could be computed by verifier. 
  Thus, running the inner-product argument with input $(P, \hat{t})$ proves the knowledge of $(\lvec, \rvec)$ in $\mathcal{O}( \text{log}_2N )$ communication.
  Furthermore, since the \proto protocol is public-coin, we can make it non-interactive using the Fiat-Shamir heuristic \cite{FiatShamir86}.\\[-2pt]
  
  %However, the base vectors for generating Pedersen vector commitments in our protocol are controlled by the prover as opposed to being generated uniformly randomly in Bulletproofs. Taking this into consideration, we use the same improved inner product argument from \cite{Bunz2018} with a stronger soundness theorem given in \cite{Lai2019}.
  
  
  \begin{theorem}
  \labelText{}{label:thm1}
  The argument presented in Figure \ref{fig:protocol_revBP} is public-coin, constant-round, perfectly complete and perfect special honest-verifier zero-knowledge.
  % \footnote[2]{We use the definitions of a public-coin, perfectly complete and perfect special honest-verifier zero-knowledge argument of knowledge as given in \cite{Lai2019}.}
  \end{theorem}
  
  \noindent \textit{Proof sketch}: The \proto protocol is public-coin since all of the challenges from $\V$ are generated uniformly randomly from $\Z_q$.
  Given a $\textsl{crs}=(\G,q,g,h,g_t)$ and an honest prover with knowledge of witness $\textsl{wit}=(\textbf{r}, \textbf{e}_{i_1}, \dots, \textbf{e}_{i_s})$ for a $\textsl{stmt}=(\textbf{C}, \textbf{I}) \in \L_{\RBmath}$, 
  it is easy to see that the three verification conditions at the end of Figure \ref{fig:protocol_revBP} hold. Thus, the protocol is perfectly complete. 
  Next, we need show that \proto is perfect special honest-verifier zero-knowledge (SHVZK) by constructing an efficient simulator $\mathcal{S}$, which can simulate the transcript of \proto
  without knowing the witness. 
  Note the difference between a Special HVZK and HVZK is that in the former, the simulator $\mathcal{S}$ is given the challenges chosen by the verifier while in the latter, simulator $\mathcal{S}$ is allowed to choose the challenges by itself.
  Perfect SHVZK implies that no adversary, even if it is computationally unbounded, would be able to distinguish between the simulated and the honestly generated transcripts for valid statements and witnesses.
  For the protocol to be perfect SHVZK, the simulated transcript needs to be identically distributed to the transcript of \proto\hspace{-1.5mm}. Detailed construction of $\mathcal{S}$ is shown in Appendix \ref{scnProofTheorem1}.\\[-2pt]
  
  \begin{theorem}
  Assuming the discrete logarithm assumption holds over $\G$, \proto has computational witness-extended-emulation for extracting a valid witness $\text{\textsl{wit}}$.
  \label{label:thm2}
  \end{theorem}
  
  \noindent \textit{Proof sketch}: Proving that \proto has computational witness-extended emulation implies showing that it is \textit{computationally sound}. 
  To do so, we need to construct a \textsf{PPT} extractor $\E$, which when given enough number of transcripts of \proto via rewinding, succeeds in construction of a valid witness as 
  defined in the language $\L_{\RBmath}$. We show the detailed construction of $\E$ in Appendix \ref{scnProofTheorem2}.
  
  \section{Security Properties of \textnormal{{\fontfamily{qag}\selectfont RevelioBP}}}
  \label{scnSecurityProperties}
  \vspace{-6pt}
  In this section, we discuss the security properties of the \proto protocol, namely inflation resistance, collusion detection, and output privacy (as defined in Section \ref{scnSecurityPropertiesDefiniton}).
  We defer the rigorous treatment of the security properties to an extended version of this paper.% due to space constraints. NOTE: Not saying space constraints because we have a column available.
  
  \subsection{Inflation Resistance}
  \vspace{-4pt}
  Theorem \ref{label:thm2} proves that a \textsf{PPT} exchange can include the tag $I_j = g_t^{r_j}h^{a_j}$ in the vector $\textbf{I}$ \textit{only if} it knows the blinding factor $r_j$ and amount $a_j$ corresponding to the output $C_{i_j} = g^{r_j}h^{a_j}$. Thus an exchange can only create tags corresponding to outputs it owns. Furthermore, since each tag $I_j$ is forced to be a Pedersen commitment to the \textit{same amount} as the output $C_{i_j}$, the exchange cannot inflate the amount being contributed by $I_j$ to $C_{\text{res}}$. Thus $C_{\text{res}}$ is a Pedersen commitment to the actual reserves $\sum_{j=1}^{s} a_j$.
  
  \subsection{Collusion Resistance}
  \vspace{-4pt}
  Suppose two exchanges generate \RPlus proofs at the same block height $t$. Ideally, each $C_i \in \C_{\text{utxo}}$ can contribute to the reserves of at most one of the exchanges. If exchange 1 who owns an output $C_i = g^{r_i}h^{a_i}$ reveals $r_i$ and $a_i$ to exchange 2, both of them can try using $C_i$ as a contributing output in their proofs of reserves. Then while creating their respective arguments \proto both exchanges will be forced to include the tag $I_j = g_t^{r_i}h^{a_i}$ in their tag vectors, revealing the collusion. This technique will work only if all exchanges agree to use the same sequence of $g_t$s in their \RPlus proofs. If exchanges 1 and 2 were to use different bases $g_t$ and $g_t'$ to generate their proofs, then collusion cannot be detected. As of now, pressure from customers and regulators seems to be the only way to ensure that all exchanges use the same $g_t$.
  
  \subsection{Output Privacy}
  \vspace{-4pt}
  Let $\lambda$ be the security parameter such that $\textsl{Setup}(1^{\lambda})$ generates the group $(\G, q, g)$ with $\log_2 q \approx \lambda$. Suppose an exchange publishes a polynomial number of proofs of reserves at block heights $t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_{f(\lambda)}$ where $f$ is a polynomial.
  Output privacy requires that a \textsf{PPT} distinguisher $\D$, which is given the $f(\lambda)$ proofs of reserves as input, cannot do better than random guessing while classifying an output as owned by the exchange. 
  Note that the $\Uppi_{\textsf{RevBP}}$ protocol itself does not reveal anything about the secrets.
  Here, we intend to analyse privacy of outputs due to the revelation of the tag vector.  
  
  The \RPlus protocol provides output privacy under the following assumptions:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item[(i)] The blinding factors of the exchange-owned outputs are chosen independently, uniformly from $\Z_q$.
    \item[(ii)] The DDH problem is hard in the group $\G$, i.e.~there is no algorithm which can solve the DDH problem in $\G$ with a running time polynomial in $\lambda$. 
  \end{enumerate}
  If the first assumption does not hold, a \textsf{PPT} adversary could identify exchange-owned outputs given a \RPlus proof. For example, consider the case when two exchange-owned outputs $C_i$ and $C_j$ have the same blinding factor $r$ but different amounts $a_i$ and $a_j$, i.e.~$C_i = g^rh^{a_i}$ and $C_j = g^rh^{a_j}$. If the exchange uses both outputs in a \RPlus proof at block height $t$, then the tags corresponding to the outputs will be $I_j = g_t^rh^{a_i}$ and $I_j = g_t^{r}h^{a_j}$. An adversary can figure out that these two tags have the same blinding factor by checking if the equality $I_j h^{-a_1} = I_j h^{-a_{2}}$ holds for some $(a_1, a_{2}) \in V^2$ where $V$ is the range of possible amounts. As the size of the set $V$ is usually small, such a search is feasible. Once the amounts $a_i$ and $a_j$ have been found, the adversary could iterate through all possible output pairs $(C, C')$ in $\C_{\text{utxo}}^t \times \C_{\text{utxo}}^t$ and check if $C h^{-a_i} = C' h^{a_j}$. If a pair of outputs satisfying this equality is found, then the adversary concludes that both of them belong to the exchange. By requiring that the blinding factors are randomly chosen, such attacks become infeasible.
  
  
  To precisely define output privacy, we use an experiment called \texttt{OutputPriv} which proceeds as follows:
  \begin{enumerate}[itemsep=3pt]
    \item For security parameter $\lambda$, the generate group parameters $(\G, q, g) \leftarrow \textsl{Setup}(1^{\lambda})$ where $q \approx 2^\lambda$. A sequence of generators $g_1, g_2, \dots, g_{f(\lambda)}$ are chosen uniformly from $\G$. These generators will be used to instantiate $g_t$ in each of the $f(\lambda)$ \RPlus proofs.
      \item The exchange creates two outputs $C_1, C_2$ with amounts $a_1, a_2$ and blinding factors $r_1, r_2 \rgen \Z_q$, i.e.~$C_1 = g^{r_1}h^{a_1}$ and $C_2=g^{r_2}h^{a_2}$.
      % The blinding factors are chosen independently and uniformly from $\Z_q$.
      \item The exchange chooses an integer $\mathfrak{b} \rgen \{1,2\}$. Note that $C_{\mathfrak{b}} = g^{r_{\mathfrak{b}}}h^{a_\mathfrak{b}}$.
      
      \item The exchange now generates $f(\lambda)$ \RPlus proofs where the UTXO vector is $\textbf{C} = (C_1, C_2)$ and the number of exchange-owned outputs is $1$ in all of them. The $l$th proof reveals a single tag $I_l = g_l^{r_{\mathfrak{b}}}h^{a_{\mathfrak{b}}}$ for $l=1,2,\ldots,f(\lambda)$, i.e.~the same exchange-owned output is used to generate each of the $l$ proofs. Let the argument of knowledge corresponding to the $l$th \RPlus proof be $\Uppi_{\RBmath}^l$.
  
      \item The $f(\lambda)$ \RPlus proofs consisting of tags $\bar{I} = (I_1, \ldots, I_{f(\lambda)})$, arguments $\bar{\Uppi} = (\Uppi_{\RBmath}^1, \ldots, \Uppi_{\RBmath}^{f(\lambda)})$ along with the generators $\bar{g} = (g_1, g_2, \ldots,g_{f(\lambda)})$, outputs $C_1,C_2$, and amounts $a_1, a_2$ are given as input to a distinguisher $\D$ which outputs $\mathfrak{b}^{\prime} \in \{1,2\}$, i.e.
      \begin{align}
        \mathfrak{b}^{\prime} = \D\left(\bar{I},\bar{\Uppi},\bar{g},C_1, C_2, a_1, a_2\right)
          % \label{label:input_to_rev_adv}
      \end{align}
      \item $\D$ succeeds if $\mathfrak{b}^{\prime}=\mathfrak{b}$. Otherwise it fails.
  \end{enumerate}
  \vspace{2pt}
  \begin{definition}
  The \RPlus proof of reserves protocol provides output privacy if every \textsf{PPT} distinguisher $\D$ in the \texttt{OutputPriv} experiment succeeds with a probability which is negligibly close to $\frac{1}{2}$.
  \end{definition}
  
  To motivate the above definition, consider an adversary who observes a \RPlus proof generated by an exchange for UTXO set $\C_{\text{utxo}}^t$ having size $n$. 
  The length of the tag vector $\textbf{I}$ reveals the number of outputs $s$ owned by the exchange. 
  Suppose the adversary is asked to identify an exchange-owned output from $\C_{\text{utxo}}^t$. 
  If it chooses an output uniformly from $\C_{\text{utxo}}^t$, then it succeeds with probability $\frac{s}{n}$. But the adversary may itself own some outputs (say, $n_a$) in $\C_\text{utxo}^t$.
  % Then by uniformly choosing from the set of UTXOs not owned by itself, the success probability can be increased to $\frac{s}{n-n_a}$. The above definition models the extreme case when $n-n_a = 2$ and $s=1$. The definition states that a \textsf{PPT} adversary can only do negligibly better than a random guessing strategy.
  Then, the success probability can be increased to $\frac{s}{n-n_a}$. The above definition models the extreme case when $n-n_a = 2$ and $s=1$. The definition states that a \textsf{PPT} adversary can only do negligibly better than a random guessing strategy.
  
  The justification for revealing the amounts $a_1, a_2$ to the distinguisher $\D$ is that the amount in a MimbleWimble output may be known to an entity other than the output owner. For instance, a MimbleWimble transaction where Alice sends some coins to Bob will result in a new output whose blinding factor is known only to Bob but the amount in this output is known to Alice.
  The above definition captures the requirement that even entities with knowledge of the amounts in outputs should not be able to identify exchange-owned outputs from the \RPlus proofs. We have the following theorem whose proof is given in Appendix \ref{scnProofTheorem3}.
  % \vspace{1pt}
  \begin{theorem}
  %\labelText{}{label:thm3}
  The \RPlus proof of reserves protocol provides output privacy in the random oracle model under the DDH assumption provided that the exchange chooses the blinding factors in its outputs uniformly and independently of each other.
  \label{label:thm3}
  \end{theorem}


  \section{Performance}
  We compare the performance of our proof of reserves protocol with \R which was the first MimbleWimble proof of reserves protocol \cite{Dutta2019b}.
  In \Rw, an exchange publishes an anonymity set $\C_{\text{anon}} \subseteq \C_{\text{utxo}}$ such that $\C_{\text{own}} \subseteq \C_{\text{anon}}$. 
  In \Rplus, the anonymity set is always equal to $\C_{\text{utxo}}$. For a fair comparison, we set $\C_{\text{anon}} = \C_{\text{utxo}}$ in \Rw. Let $n = \left| \C_{\text{utxo}} \right|$ and $s = \left|\C_{\text{own}}\right|$. 
  \R proof sizes are $\mathcal{O}(n)$ while \RPlus proof sizes are $\mathcal{O}(s+\log_2(sn))$. 
  The exact proof sizes are:

  \begin{table}[h!]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{ | L{2.5cm} | C{4cm}| C{4cm} | } 
    \hline
     & \#Elements in $\G$ & \#Elements in $\Z_q$ \\ 
    \hline
    \R & $n+1$ & $5n$ \\ 
    \hline
    \RB & $s + 2\lceil\text{log}_2N\rceil + 4$ & $5$ \\ 
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Proof sizes of \R and \RB protocols}
    \label{table:perf}
  \end{table}
    
  \noindent
  % \begin{align*}
  %    & & & \hspace{-1cm} \text{\#Elements in } \G & & \text{\#Elements in } \Z_q \\
  %    & \R & & \hspace{-1cm} n+1 & & 5n \\
  %    & \text{\Rplus}  & & \hspace{-1cm} s + 2\lceil\text{log}_2N\rceil + 4 & & 5
  % \end{align*} 
  where $N = sn + n + s + 3$. The logarithmic dependence of the \RPlus proof size on the UTXO set size $n$ is the main advantage of \RPlus over \Rw.
  This is illustrated in Figure \ref{subfig:revBP1} where we compare the proof sizes of the \R and \RPlus protocols as a function of $n$ for $s=20$. 
  For a UTXO set size of $2^{17}$, the \RPlus proof is a mere $2.9$ KB compared to a 300 MB \R proof.
  
  %\subsection{Running Time}
  % We note that the main component of the \RPlus proof generation algorithm is a Bulletproofs protocol \cite{Bunz2018} used to generate the argument $\Uppi_{\textsf{Rev} \plus}$. The major difference is in the construction of the base vector used for computing Pedersen commitments to the secret vectors which results in more number of inner-product based constraint equations. However, since the basic framework remains the same, we can estimate the running time for generating the argument $\Uppi_{\textsf{Rev} \plus}$ using Bulletproofs with appropriate input sizes.

\end{figure}
  
  We have implemented \RPlus in Rust over the secp256k1 elliptic curve. The \R running times were estimated using the simulation code made available by Dutta \textit{et al} \cite{RevelioPerfRepo}.
  All the experiments were run on an Intel Core i7 2.6 GHz CPU.
  Our simulation code is open-sourced on GitHub \cite{RevelioBPPerfRepo}. 
  Figure \ref{subfig:revBP3} shows the \RPlus and \R proof generation and verification times as a function of the UTXO set size for $s=20$.
  % For a constant $s$, we see a linear growth in the timings of both \RB and \R as a function of UTXO set size $n$.
  % The plot shows that the proof generation of \RB is typically 2X slower than that of \Rw.
  % This difference in proof generation timings widens as $s$ increases. 
  % On the other hand, the verification of a \RB proof is much faster than its generation because of a single multi-exponentiation check in the inner product argument verification.
  % In fact, we see that the verification of \RB proof is faster than the verification of a \R proof.
  For a constant own set size $s=10$, we observe the following:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item[(i)] A linear growth in the running times of both \RB and \R as a function of $n$.
    \item[(ii)] The \RB proof generation is typically 2X slower than that of \R proof generation.
    \item[(iii)] Although both the generation and verification of \RB proofs if linear in $n$ for a constant $s$, the verification is around 2.5X faster than its generation because of a single multi-exponentiation check in the verification of inner product protocol.
    \item[(iv)] The \RB verification is $20\%$ faster than the verification of a \R proof.
  \end{enumerate}
  
  % Another difference between \R and \RB is the dependence of proof generation and verification times on $s$. 
  Furthermore, while the running time of \R is independent of $s$, it scales as $\mathcal{O}(s n)$ for \RBw. 
  % This exacerbates the already high proof generation and verification time of \RB.
  Figure \ref{subfig:revBP4} shows the generation and verification times respectively as a function of $s$ for $n=10^3$.  
  Also, the proof size of \RB proofs grow linearly with $s$ while that of \R remains constant.
  This is shown in Figure \ref{subfig:revBP2} for a constant anonymity set size $n=10^3$.
  This implies that for a constant UTXO set $n$, the verification in \RB is faster than \R only upto a particular $s$.
  Similarly, the difference between \RB and \R proof generation widens as $s$ increases.
  To illustrate this in practical terms, the size of the current UTXO set in the Grin blockchain as of June 7, 2020 is 161,000 \cite{GrinScanWebsite}.
  For this UTXO set size and own output set size equal to 100, an exchange could take upto 160 minutes to generate a \RPlus proof while taking less than $34$ minutes to generate a \R proof.
  The customers of the exchange can verify \RB and \R proofs in 68 and 34 minutes respectively.
  For an exchange which owns 200 outputs in the current UTXO set, the \RB generation and verification times would rise to 320 minutes and 130 minutes respectively, while the timings of \R remain unchanged.
  % Although \RPlus proofs are much slower to generate, they are also much smaller in size. In situations where an exchange may need to store several historical proofs for audit purposes, proof size will be a bigger factor than generation time. Also, these generation times are based on unoptimized non-parallel code on commodity hardware. They can be decreased significantly using multicore CPUs or FPGAs.
  
  % The magnificently smaller size of \RPlus proofs would enable exchanges to store several historical proofs for audit purposes. But the smaller proof size comes at the cost of slow proof generation and verification $(\mathcal{O}(s \cdot n))$.
  % Although the generation times stated above are based on unoptimized non-parallel code on commodity hardware, the proof generation and verification would still be a bottleneck in practical deployment even after a $2\text{ to }3$ times speedup using multi-core CPUs or FPGAs.
  % The verification can significantly be reduced using multi-exponentiation, but prover computation would still be linear in $n$.
  % While ideal in terms of privacy guarantees, \RPlus faces the practical difficulty of slow generation. To this end, we devise an improved \RPlus protocol with similar privacy guarantees, comparable proof size and significantly lower prover and verifier computation. 
  
  \subsection{Scalability and Performance Trade-off}
  
  The smaller proof sizes of \RB would enable exchanges to store several historical proofs for audit purposes.
  Further, if proofs of reserves are to be uploaded on the blockchain for public verifiability, smaller proof size becomes crucial.
  The benefits in scalability due to \RB comes at the price of performance.
  % The verification time can significantly be reduced using multi-exponentiation, but prover computation would still be linear in $sn$. So, if an exchange chooses for smaller proof size, it has to suffer from large generation time.
  From the customer point of view too, larger verification times are undesirable given their limited computational resources.
  %even after multi-exponentiation in verification, more than an hour to verify a proof might be too tedious. 
  
  The simpler formulation of \Rw, on the other hand, allows faster generation and verification. 
  Therefore, if the proof size is not a concern for an exchange, using \R can reduce computational cost for the exchanges as well as the customers. 
  % and feasible to deploy in real-life systems. 
  Moreover, the design of \R allows parallelization of its proof generation as well as verification.
  On the contrary, \RB relies on the recursive inner product protocol, preventing parallelization of proof generation.
  Also, since the base vector used in \RB depends on the tag vector published by an exchange, \RB proofs of multiple exchanges on the same blockchain state cannot be aggregated.  
  Lastly, if exchanges are required to generate proofs of reserves after every $K$ blocks are mined, the proof generation time needs to be less than $K$ minutes\footnote{The average inter-block time is one minute in both Grin and Beam (the two most popular MimbleWimble-based cryptocurrencies).}.
  In such cases, proofs with smaller running times would be preferred.
  We conclude by summarizing the trade-offs in using \R and \RB in Table \ref{table:rb_vs_r}.

  % The language of \R as well as \RB protocols is based on proving the ownership of $s\text{-out-of-}n$ outputs from an anonymity set.
  % This ensures the privacy of exchange-owned outputs in \R and \RB protocols. 
  % % The exchanges have flexibility in the choice of anonymity set in case of \Rw, while for \RBw, the entire UTXO set corresponding to a particular blockchain state forms the anonymity set.
  % % A \RB proof given by an exchange is implicitly linked to a blockchain state, which implies that  
  % However, in \RBw, the number of exchange-owned outputs is revealed. Since amounts in Grin are in a range of $[0,2^{64})$, one can estimate the maximum reserves an exchange owns knowing 
  % the number of outputs it owns. An adversary who is involved in a transaction with the exchange as a receiver of funds might figure out a lower bound on the reserves. Thus, the exchanges would
  % be skeptical of using \RB since they might not want to reveal the total number of outputs they own. \R does not possess this shortcoming and no information about the reserves is leaked in \Rw.
  
  
  \section{Conclusion}
  To avoid proof sizes which are linear in the size of anonymity set, we have presented Bulletproofs-based proof of reserves protocol \RB with proof size scaling logarithmically in the size of the anonymity set.
  Having implemented \RBw, we conclude that the smaller proof sizes it offers comes with the cost of larger proof generation and verification times.
  \Rw, the first proof of reserves for MimbleWimble, does better in terms of generation and verification times.
  An exchange has to make a trade-off between scalability and performance and choose which protocol suits their needs better: \RB with smaller proof size and large generation times or \R with larger proof sizes and faster generation times.

  % \section{Improved \RPlus}
  
  % % The \proto argument of knowledge individually proves knowledge of each exchange-owned output in the UTXO set $\C_{\text{utxo}}^t$, via a single Bulletproofs-like protocol. 
  % % The prover and verifier computation is $\mathcal{O}(n \cdot s)$ for \protow. Since the size of the UTXO set $(n)$, in general is large, the prover and verifier computation 
  % % becomes a bottleneck for implementing \RPlus in practice. Although the verification can significantly be reduced using multi-exponentiation, prover computation would still be $\mathcal{O}(n \cdot s)$.
  
  % Since \proto reveals the number of exchange-onwed outputs $(s)$, one can guess an exchange-owned output with probability $(\frac{s}{n})$ from the UTXO set.
  % If we consider some different anonymity set structure such that the probability of a random guess of an exchange-owned output remains consistent, we could reduce the prover computation depending on the size of the
  % anonymity set. 
  % % We explore one such structure where each exchange-owned output is assigned a different anonymity set.
  
  % The \proto argument of knowledge individually proves knowledge of each exchange-owned output in the UTXO set $\C_{\text{utxo}}^t$, via a single Bulletproofs-like protocol.
  % Instead of proving that a particular output is one of the outputs in $\C_{\text{utxo}}^t$, we can use a smaller anonymity set for the same. Further, for each output, we could 
  % use a different anonymity set (of same size). Using this idea, we construct an argument of knowledge \Iproto having different anonymity sets for each exchange-owned outputs.
  
  % Consider a set $\textsl{Idx} = \{(b_1, l_1), (b_2, l_2), \dots, (b_s, l_s) \}$ of pair of indices where each $b_j, l_j \in [n]$ denote the beginning and end index respectively of the anonymity set $\textbf{R}_j$ corresponding to exchange-owned output $C_{i_j}$. 
  % Assume that the anonymity set sizes are the same for all $j \in [s]$. Thus, let $n^{\prime} = n_j = (l_j-b_j)$ for all $j \in [s]$.
  % \begin{equation*}
  %   \C_{\text{utxo}}^t = \{ C_1, \ \dots, \ \underbrace{C_{b_j}, \ \dots , \ C_{i_j}, \ \dots, \ C_{l_j}}_{\textbf{R}_j} , \ \dots, \ C_n \}
  % \end{equation*}
  % Note that the set $\textbf{R}_j$ may contain exchange-owned outputs other than $C_{i_j}$. Corresponding to each of these anonymity sets, 
  % we define a binary vector $\textbf{e}_{i_j} \in \{0,1\}^{n^{\prime}}$ such that it has $1$ at index $(i_j - b_j)$ and $0$ otherwise.
  
  % We now design the argument of knowledge \Iproto based on different anonymity sets. The language \Ilang for \Iproto is given as 
  % \begin{align}
  %   \hspace{-1.5mm}
  %   \mathcal{L}_{\RBmath}^I  & = \hspace{-1mm}
  %   \left\{ ( \{\textbf{R}_j\}_{1}^{s}, \textbf{I}) \Bigg| 
  %   \hspace{-3mm}
  %   \text{
  %   \begin{tabular}{c} 
  %   $\exists (\textbf{r}, \textbf{e}_{i_1},\ldots,\textbf{e}_{i_s}) \text{ such that }$
  %   \\ 
  %   $ g^{-r_j} \textbf{R}_j^{\textbf{e}_{j}} = g_t^{-r_j}I_j  \forall j \in [s]$ 
  %   \end{tabular}
  %   }
  %   \hspace{-3mm}
  %   \right\}
  %   \label{eqnRevelioPlus2Language}
  % \end{align} 
  
  % Using a uniformly generated scalar $u \rgen \Z_q$, we combine the constraint equations.
  % \begin{gather}
  %   \prod_{j=1}^{s} \big( g^{-r_j} g_t^{r_j} \textbf{R}_j^{\textbf{e}_{j}}I_j^{-1}\big)^{u^{j-1}} = 1 \nonumber \\
  %   \therefore g^{\eta_1} \cdot g_t^{\eta_2} \cdot \textbf{R}^{\hat{\textbf{e}}} \cdot \hat{I} = 1 \label{mainEquality2}
  % \end{gather}
  
  % \noindent where $\eta_1 = -\langle \textbf{u}^s, \textbf{r} \rangle$, $\eta_2 = -\eta_1$, $\hat{I} = \textbf{I}^{-\textbf{u}^s}$,
  % $\tilde{\textbf{e}} = (\textbf{e}_{i_1} \| u \textbf{e}_{i_2} \| \dots \| u^{s-1} \textbf{e}_{i_s} )$, and
  % $\textbf{R} = (\textbf{R}_1 \| \textbf{R}_2 \| \dots \| \textbf{R}_s)$. Equation (\ref{mainEquality2}) is the \textit{main equality} for \Iproto.
  % For a scalar $w \in \Z_q$ and $\textbf{p} \rgen \G^{(sn^{\prime} + 3)}$
  % and $\textbf{g}^{\prime} \rgen \G^{(sn^{\prime} + s)}$, we construct the base  and exponent (secret) vector as 
  % \begin{align}
  %   \textbf{g}_w &= \big((g \| g_t \| \textbf{R} \| \hat{I})^{\circ w} \circ \textbf{p}\big)  \| \textbf{g}^{\prime} & \in \G^{N} \label{label:Igenerator}\\
  %   \cL &= (\eta_1 \| \eta_2 \| \hat{\textbf{e}} \| 1 \| \Emat \| \textbf{r}) & \in \Z_q^{N}
  % \end{align}
  
  % \noindent where $\Emat = (\textbf{e}_{i_1} \| \dots \| \textbf{e}_{i_s})$ and $N = 2sn^{\prime} + s +3$.

  % The \Iproto protocol can be realised by running \proto described in Protocol (\ref{label:proto1}) with the base vector $\textbf{g}_w$ (equation (\ref{label:Igenerator})), exponent vectors $\cL, \cR$ (Fig. \hyperref[label:witness_2]{6}) and constraint vectors defined by Fig. (\hyperref[label:conVec1_2]{7}).

  %   Assuming the discrete logarithm assumption holds over $\G$, \Iproto is public-coin, constant-round, perfectly complete,

  % \subsection{Comparison: \Iproto vs \proto}
  % \label{subscnComparisonIRvsR}
  
  % %TODO Need to argue about privacy guarantee differences between Revelio+ and improved Revelio+
  % For an adversary $\mathcal{A}$ trying to guess index $i_j$ of an exchnage-owned output, we need the probability of guessing randomly from $\textbf{C}$ and $\textbf{R}_j$ to be equal.
  % Let $k \in [n]$ be the index guessed by $\mathcal{A}$. We need  
  % \begin{equation*}
  %   \Pr[ k = i_j | k \leftarrow \mathcal{A}(\textbf{C})] = \Pr[ k = i_j | k \leftarrow \mathcal{A}(\textbf{R}_j)]
  % \end{equation*}
  % Further, since anonymity sets $\textbf{R}_i$ and $\textbf{R}_j$, for some $i, j \in [s]$, could have common outputs, it effectively improves the chances of adversary $\mathcal{A}$ succeeding.
  % Thus, we choose $n^{\prime}$ such that $\frac{1}{n^{\prime} - m} = \frac{s}{n}$, where $m = \textsl{max}_{i,j}\{|\textbf{R}_i \cap \textbf{R}_j|\}$.
  % Assuming $m \ll n^{\prime}$, we have $n^{\prime} \approx \frac{n}{s}$. This implies that the prover as well as verifier computation would be reduced 
  % by a factor of $\frac{s}{2}$ as compared to that in \proto.
  
  % The improved \RPlus protocol has to include the index set \textsl{Idx} in its proof, increasing the proof size by $s$ scalars.
  % The total proof size then becomes $\mathcal{O}(2s + \text{log}_2(2s n^{\prime}))$. For $n^{\prime} \approx \frac{n}{s}$, the proof size of \Iproto is marginally greater than that of \proto.  
  
  % % The analysis of privacy of outputs given multiple \Iproto proofs for different block heights becomes difficult since choice of anonymity sets is left to the prover. 
  % % More precisely, let the anonymity set corresponding to an exchange-owned output $C_{i_j} \in \C_{\text{utxo}}^{t_1} \cap \C_{\text{utxo}}^{t_2}$ be $\textbf{R}_j^1$
  % % and $\textbf{R}_j^2$ respectively for block heights $t_1, t_2$. An adversary can figure out the outputs which remained unchanged comparing $\textbf{R}_j^1$ and $\textbf{R}_j^2$.
  % % This enhances his chances of correctly guessing $i_j$.  
  
  % % If an exchange owns $5\%$ outputs of the UTXO set, the anonymity set
  % % size using \Iproto reduces by $\approx \hspace{-1mm} 20$ times, thus reducing prover and verifier work by $\approx \hspace{-1mm} 10$ times. 
  
  
  % % The proof size in a \Iproto protocol becomes $\mathcal{O}(\text{log}_2(2sn^{\prime} + 2s + 3))$.
